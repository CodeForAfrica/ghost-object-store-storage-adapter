# Ghost Object Store Storage Adapter

An Object Store storage adapter for Ghost CMS that allows storing images and other files in object storage instead of the local file system.

Works with any object storage service that uses an S3-compatible API including Cloudflare R2, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, Wasabi, and Amazon S3.

**NOTE**: Only MinIO and Amazon S3 have been tested extensively so your mileage may vary with others.


## Features

- Store images and files in object storage
- Automatically serve files from the object storage
- Support for all Ghost image storage operations (save, delete, exists, read, serve)
- Additionally supports the `saveRaw` operation for raw file uploads
- Full compatibility with Ghost's storage adapter system
- S3-compatible interface using AWS SDK v3


## Installation

To get the adapter working, first, use `npm` to install it then move it to your Ghost installation's `content/adapters/storage` directory.

To achieve this, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/lib/ghost/content/adapters/storage/object-store
npm install https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/ghost-object-store-storage-adapter.git --omit=dev
cp -r ./node_modules/ghost-object-store-storage-adapter/* /var/lib/ghost/content/adapters/storage/object-store
```

Once this is done, proceed to configure the adapter as described below.

## Configuration

Add the following configuration to your Ghost config.js file (or environment variables):

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "active": "object-store",
    "media":{
      "adapter": "object-store"
    },
    "files": {
      "adapter": "object-store"
    },
    "object_store": {
      "endpoint": "localhost:9000",
      "accessKey": "youracesskey",
      "secretKey": "yoursecretkey",
      "bucket": "ghost",
      "region": "eu-west-1",
      "useSSL": false
    }
  }
}
```


### Environment Variables

```bash

storage__media__adapter: object-store
storage__object_store__endpoint: localhost:9000

storage__object_store__secretKey: yoursecretkey
storage__object_store__bucket: bucket

```
